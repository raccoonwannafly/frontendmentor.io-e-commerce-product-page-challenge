## My process

### Built with
Pure HTML, CSS and JS


### What I learned
This was another great challenge, for me surprisingly the toughest part was not making the UI but rather the modal gallery, however I came accross this video from WebDevSimplified: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywtkJkxJsdg&t=543s Who made an excellent point on how to use HTML dialog feature to create a modal window (or layer), and with that I was able to take control of my design of this challenge and complete it within a day.. not a big trophy ik but I'm proud of that :>.

### Continued development
Now the rest is just responsive design for mobile devices, this can be done by adjusting some elements with or without media queries and also adjusting relative units, I'll try to update this in the future as its not my current priority. Also some of the thumbnails dont update themselves among the modal layer and original layer.
Also the images loading kinda slow, maybe I should start using script defer instead of putting them all within index.html. Any feedback'd be appreciated ^^


### Useful resources

- [WebDevSimplified](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywtkJkxJsdg&t=543s) - This channel helped me tremendously throughout my web dev learning journey. He makes short and concise videos, enough for me to get the idea and do my own research.
- [F8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB6cJh_bb1U) - Vietnamese channel with decent and informative content.
